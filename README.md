## About Me

I’m a software builder with a mission.

After beating Acute Myeloid Leukemia, I committed to using technology to solve meaningful problems—with a focus on healthcare, automation, and accessible systems. Whether it’s optimizing campus systems, developing AI models, or building a startup from scratch, I thrive at the edge of engineering and impact.

Currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Penn State, I’m building experience through personal projects, applied ML bootcamps, and leadership in tech-focused nonprofits like THON.
