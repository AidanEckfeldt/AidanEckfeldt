## About Me

I’m a software engineer-in-training with a passion for building systems that work—fast, clean, and at scale.  
From automating university systems to launching an e-commerce business, I bring technical range, curiosity, and a get-it-done mindset.

Currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Penn State, I focus on applied learning through real-world projects, leadership roles, and hands-on experimentation in machine learning, backend engineering, and interface design.
