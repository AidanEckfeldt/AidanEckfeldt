## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Penn State with a passion for building tools that solve real-world problems—from scheduling platforms and automation bots to AI models and web systems. I’m currently looking to add a second major in Artificial Intelligence to deepen my technical foundation and expand my work on cutting-edge systems.  

I serve as a Technology Captain for THON 2026, the world’s largest student-run philanthropy, where I help improve THON.org’s digital infrastructure in support of an $18M fundraising mission. I've also worked in tech project management at NYU Langone Health and completed the Nittany AI Bootcamp, where I applied machine learning to real-world challenges.  

I’m always looking to grow as an engineer, strategist, and teammate—especially in fast-paced environments where technology and impact intersect.
