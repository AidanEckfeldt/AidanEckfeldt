## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Penn State with a passion for building tools that solve real-world problems‚Äîfrom scheduling platforms and automation bots to AI models and web systems. I‚Äôm currently looking to add a second major in Artificial Intelligence to deepen my technical foundation and expand my work on cutting-edge systems. I serve as a Technology Captain for THON 2026, the world‚Äôs largest student-run philanthropy, where I help improve THON.org‚Äôs digital infrastructure in support of an $18M fundraising mission. I've also worked in tech project management at NYU Langone Health and completed the Nittany AI Bootcamp, where I applied machine learning to real-world challenges. I‚Äôm always looking to grow as an engineer, strategist, and teammate‚Äîespecially in fast-paced environments where technology and impact intersect.
