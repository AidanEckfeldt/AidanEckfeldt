## 🚀 Featured Projects

### ⭐ **MyCord Network Chat Client**  
*C • POSIX Sockets • Multithreading • ANSI TUI • GenAI-assisted*  
Creator (December 2025)  
- Developed a fully featured TCP chat client implementing the custom MyCord protocol, supporting LOGIN, MESSAGE_SEND, MESSAGE_RECV, SYSTEM, and DISCONNECT messages using packed message structs and fixed 1064-byte framing  
- Engineered robust networking via POSIX sockets, IPv4 TCP, DNS resolution, CLI parsing (`--ip`, `--domain`, `--port`, `--quiet`), and strict input validation to avoid server-side disconnect triggers  
- Built a multithreaded architecture using `pthread_create` / `pthread_join`, enabling asynchronous message reception while handling local user input; implemented graceful shutdown via `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, EOF detection, and automatic LOGOUT dispatch  
- Implemented reliable buffered reading logic tolerating partial packets, EINTR interruptions, and socket edge cases—ensuring crash-free operation across thousands of messages  
- Added full ANSI-colored formatting: system-message styling, red disconnect alerts, timestamps, mention highlighting, and a quiet mode (`--quiet`)  
- Used GenAI for modular design, input sanitization, and improved error-handling while maintaining full understanding of all generated code through iterative refinement  
- Built an optional ANSI-based Text User Interface (`--tui`) featuring a fixed bottom input bar, auto-scrolling chat history, protected input line during incoming messages, and keyboard message-history navigation
